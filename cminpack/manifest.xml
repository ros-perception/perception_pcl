<p>
    <em>This is the official description of Minpack, from the original ReadMe file:</em>
    Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear
    least squares problems. Five algorithmic paths each include a core
    subroutine and an easy-to-use driver. The algorithms proceed either from an
    analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or directly from the problem
    functions. The paths include facilities for systems of equations with a
    banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares problems with a large amount of
    data, and for checking the consistency of the Jacobian matrix with the
    functions.
</p>
<p>
    Minpack is probably the best open-source implementation of the
    Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (in fact, it is even better, since it adds to
    L-M automatic variables scaling). There is another open-source L-M
    implementation in C/C++, levmar by Manolis Lourakis, but unfortunately is is
    released under the GPL, which restricts its inclusion in commercial
    software. Minpack is licensed under a BSD-like license (available in the
    distribution).
</p>
<p>
    I took a dozen of hours to rework all these problems, and came out with a
    pure C version of Minpack, with has standard (ISO C99) parameters passing,
    is fully reentrant, multithread-safe, and has a full set of examples and
    tests:
</p>
<p>
      1. Input variables are now passed by value, output variables are passed by
      reference. The keyword "const" is used as much as possible for constant
      arrays. The return value of each function is now used to get the function
      status (it was obtained via the IFLAG or INFO parameter in Minpack).
</p>
<p>
      2. All non-const static variables were removed, and the code was tested
      after that. Luckily, Minpack didn't use the nastiest feature in FORTRAN: all
      local variables are static, so that a function can behave differently when
      you call it several times.
</p>
<p>
      3. The function to be minimized and all the Minpack functions now take
      an extra "void*" argument, which can be used to pass any
      pointer-to-struct or pointer-to-class, and you can put all you extra
      parameters and datd in that struct. Just cast this pointer to the
      appropriate pointer type in your function, and there they are! There
      is no need for global variables anymore. Be careful if you access the
      same object from different threads, though.
</p>
<p>
      4. The Debian project did a C include file for Minpack. It still needed some
      work (add consts and C++ compatibility), so I did this work, and used the
      include file for the FORTRAN version as the base for my C/C++ version.
</p>
<p>
      5. The Debian project also translated all the FORTRAN examples to C. I
      worked from these to produce examples which also call my C/C++ version of
      Minpack instead of the FORTRAN version. Also included in the distribution
      are reference output files produced by the test runs (for comparison).
